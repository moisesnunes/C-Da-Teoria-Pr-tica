## Préfacio

This book is primarily addressed to students who are taking a course on the C language,
to those who desire to pursue self-study of the C language, as well as to programmers
already familiar with C who want to test their knowledge and skills. It could also prove
useful to instructors of a C course who are looking for explanatory programming examples
to add in their lectures.
So what exactly differentiates this book from the others in the field? This book tests the
skills of both beginners and more experienced developers by providing an easy-to-read
compilation of the C theory enriched with tips and advice as well as a large number of
difficulty-scaled solved programming exercises.
When we first encountered the C language as students, we needed a book that would
introduce us quickly to the secrets of the C language as well as provide in-depth knowledge
on the subject—a book with a focus on providing inside information and programming
knowledge through practical examples and meaningful advice. That is the spirit that
this book aims to capture.
The programming examples are short but concrete, providing programming know-how
in a substantial manner. Rest assured that if you are able to understand the examples and
solve the exercises, you can safely go on to edit longer programs and start your programming
career successfully. The source code of the exercises is available at www.c4all.gr.
For all of you who intend to deal with computer programming, a little bit of advice coming
from our long experience may come in handy:
• Programming is a difficult task that, among other things, requires a calm mind,
a clear development plan, a methodical approach, patience, self-confidence, and
luck as well.
• When coding, try to write in a simple and comprehensive way for your own benefit
and for those who are going to read your code. Always remember that the
debug, maintenance, and upgrade of a code written in a complex way are a painful
process.
• Hands-on! To learn the features of any programming language, you must write
your own programs and experiment with them.
• Programming is definitely a creative activity, but do not forget that there are plenty
of creative, pleasant, and less stressful activities in life. Do not waste your life in
front of a computer screen, searching for losing pointers, buffer overflows, memory
overruns, and buggy conditions. Program for some time and then have some fun.
Keep living and do not keep programming.
Enjoy the C flight; it will be safe, with some turbulence, though.
